## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change for each step before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[] Remove "playlist" from PlayerState in YoutubeMusic.tsx. Make sure that nothing is using it. Playlist.tsx should use "songs" and "suggestions" instead.

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Handle media keys
[] Get ids from songs and save that to m3u
[] Make an expanded playlist view
