[] On app start, find all .mp3 files in `/Users/jay/Downloads/mp3` - I will make that a setting later
[] The playlist selector should have another option for "Local Files"
[] When local files is selected it should list the .mp3 files I have in that folder
[] Make an html page that can be sent with javascript an mp3 filename to play it in an html audio element
[] Add that page as a hidden webview
[] When I click a local file to play, it should play that song
[] The playback controls should control the local media webview to play/pause
[] The forward and back buttons should play the next/preview mp3 files
