## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[] Let's redesign the dropdown that shows for the playlist selector. I don't want to change the defaults, so make DropdownMenu customizable. In this case it should have no background and just display a down caret to the right. The text should be a slightly faded white and when hovered it should turn white.

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Handle media keys
