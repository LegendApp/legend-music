## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change for each step before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] Remove "playlist" from PlayerState in YoutubeMusic.tsx. Make sure that nothing is using it. Playlist.tsx should use "songs" and "suggestions" instead.
[x] Do a refactor to reduce duplication in code in YouTubeMusicPlayer.tsx. Use good coding practices and don't break anything.
[] Do a refactor to remove files in the Components folder that are specific to Github, Issues, etc... Those are from the project I used to bootstrap this one. If anything could be a reusable component for this music player do not remove it.

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Handle media keys
[] Make an expanded playlist view
