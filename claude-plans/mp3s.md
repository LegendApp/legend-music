## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change before moving to the next step
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] The local track names have "%20" in them which looks bad and is preventing them from playing correctly - they should be parsed as spaces
[x] There should be a horizontal slider with the current track position at the bottom of the now playing area. It should update every second with song position.
[x] Dragging the slider should set the track position
[x] The playlist selector should display the selected playlist name
[x] The currently playing song does not need a music icon to the right, it looks weird

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)
