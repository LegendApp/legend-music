## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] I added a native module for WindowControls inside LegendMusic-macOS. Please make a bridge for that on the React Native side and update TitleBar.tsx to use it rather than access the native module directly.
[x] Make sure the WindowControls native module is linked in the xcodeproj

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Handle media keys
[] Make an expanded playlist view
