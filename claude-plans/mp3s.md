## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change before moving to the next step, including this file

- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] The Select component's renderItem function should have a second parameter for `mode: 'item' | 'preview'`, and use 'preview' instead of `renderItemText`
[x] The Select component should use LegendList to render the items.

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)
