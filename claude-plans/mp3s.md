## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change for each step before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] The circle in the custom slider should only appear when the slider is hovered. And it should be a vertical line that animates its height from 1px to 3px.
[x] DropdownMenu should have a prop for the content to have a maxwidth of the side of the trigger, and PlaylistSelector should use that
[x] Change Playlists to be an object keyed by id rather than an array
[x] Change the youtube music player to save and load its playlists using the functions in Playlists.ts

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] Handle media keys
[] Make an expanded playlist view
