## Instructions

- Follow all of the steps in order, one by one
- Check them off in this file as they are completed
- Do a git commit with a brief description of the change before moving to the next step, including this file
- Remember that this is a React Native MacOS app, so iOS only APIs will not work.
- Use Legend State for state
- Use Reanimated for animations

## Steps

[x] The local track names have "%20" in them which is preventing them from playing correctly - they should be parsed as spaces
[x] The playback slider should always be visible
[x] react-native-slider does not work on macos. Let's just make a slider in javascript.

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)
