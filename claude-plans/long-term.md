## Being a good mp3 player

[] Support local playlists

## Plan for later (do not do these yet)

[] stateSaved$ and settings$ are currently different things. Should they be merged? Or why keep them separate?
[] Make an expanded playlist view
    [] Local files should display as a tree of artist / album
[] ExpoFSPersistPlugin should be extractable to legend-state, match the behavior of other persist plugins
[] Should I just focus on mp3 and playlists for v1, and punt ytm or mark it as experimental?
